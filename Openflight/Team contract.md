**CS 225 Data Structures**
Team Contract(yijiag3-shujie2-suwenw2-jiewenw2)

### Communication

1. **Team Meetings**
Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 8-10 PM using Zoom. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Yijia Gao. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.

2. **Assistance** 
Every team member can be contacted through Wechat. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.

3. **Respect**
The note-taker for the week will also serve as the "project lead" for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision. However, design decisions can be accepted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.
 
### Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution**
Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and every team member can choose which deliverables they want to work on. 

2. **Time Commitment** 
Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.

3. **Conflict Resolution** 
When disagreements occur, a majority vote will be taken to determine who is right and who is wrong. If some team members have not accomplished their tasks, each weekâ€™s project leader is responsible for push them to finish the task and promote the progress of the project.
