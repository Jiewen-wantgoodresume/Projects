The program will first scan for the starting location for the BFS. If location is invalid, it will continue to scan for next valid input.
Only 1 BFS is performed because of redundancy of multiple searches.

Then the program will perform shortest path algorithms on locations in this file until the end of the file.
Program will first scan for starting location. If location is invalid, it will continue to scan for next valid input.
(NA is an invalid input)
After a valid input, the program will scan scan again for destination.
After a valid input again, the program will scan one last time for a landmark (stop between start and destination)
Order of inputs for shortest path algorithms:
Starting location
Destination location
Landmark location
