(4/12-4/18):
For this week, we discussed what we plan to finish before the mid-project check-in meeting. Before the meeting, we will try to finish collecting data as CSV files and store them in the Data folder, create both the Makefile and readFromFile, and lastly complete the finddist fucntion using the haversine formula to help find the distance between two coordinates. 

(4/19-4/25):
In this week, we fnished BFS function. Additionally, Dijkstra's algorithm was implemented and finds the most direct flight from start to destination by the shortest distance traveled. The main.cpp file was updated in order to take input from the user for the starting location and final destination, then perform a BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm and print the results. 

(4/25-5/2):
For this week, we finished Landmark Algorithm, it is the algorithm based on Dijkstra Algorithm, we use the landmark between starting point and ending point to finally calcualte the shortest path. And we also debugged the algorithm for the case that there is no landmark between starting point and destination.

(5/2-5/12):
For this week, we will try to finalize our project to get ready for the final checkpoint. Both a project presentation powerpoint and a presentation recording will be made to showcase our final results.
