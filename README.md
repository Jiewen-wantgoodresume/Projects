CS 411 project : SQL-based Book searching and recommendation database hosted on GCP. In our database, we included book, author, genre, interaction, review, and similar options,
A trigger procedure process is responsible for constant updates on the new book added, which is after inserting in the book table. We have two stored procedures, one is about adding new books into the database, another one is about fuzzy search, which means users would get similar results when they enter fuzzy information. Our group also accomplished the application interface with tabs to check authors, add books, and the user log-in function is also embedded for the ease of access
